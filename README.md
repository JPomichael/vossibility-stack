vossibility
---------------------

Vossibility provides better visibility for your open source project. The project was initially
started for [Docker](https://docker.io) but is not tied to it in any way.

This repository provides a full usable stack to get started using `docker-compose`. See the
[`vossibility-collector`](https://github.com/icecrime/vossibility-collector) repository for the core
component of the project.
